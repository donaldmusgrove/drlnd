# Banana Navigation Report

## Learning Algorithm
The report needs to clearly describe the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. Also describe the DQN model architectures.


## Plot of Rewards
A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.
